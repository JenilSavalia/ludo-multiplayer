STEP 1 - ROOM CREATION

user creates room -> /create-multiplayer-room 
receices a roomId

other 3 users can join the game (4 player are reqired for game to start)


STEP 2 - GAME STARTS

note :
game should be synced with game state;


user sends command to roll dice
{
    "userToken" : "authtoken",
    "action" : "ROLL_DICE"
    "payload" : "BLUE"
}

before generating a random number , server must check if current turn is in sync with given color 

client broadcasts generated number to all user (including user itself)

{
    "dice_value" : Random_generated_number
}

client broadcasts movabe list tokens to all users

{
    movableTokens : [token.....]
}


client  selects token from movable tokens and sends tokenId as payload

{
    "userToken" : "authtoken",
    selectedToken : "TokenId"
}

server broadcasts the token moved by user to all other users


server checks if moved token new position conflicts and kills other token or note

and if kill happens , broadcasts it to all members

{
    killed_token = "TokenID"
}
